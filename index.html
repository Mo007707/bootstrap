            <h3 id="agile">What is Agile?</h3>
            <p>Agile is a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and getting them done, implementing them into the program allowing the client to use the program even though its not complete</p>
            
            <h3 id="scrum">What is scrum</h3>
              <p>Agile PM framework to develop, deliver and sustain complex products. Scrum - getting work done. Scrum and agile are not the same thing. Scrum is about continuously shipping value to customers. And agile is just a set of value and principles. You cant just go agile, it takes a lot more to change the way you think, however something like agile can help you start thinking in a more agile way and help you building more agile way into communication and work. </p>
        
            <h3 id="whydo">Why do software teams use scrum</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Requirements change</li>
                <li>Goals change</li>
                <li>Situations change</li>
              </ul>
        
              <h3 id="morescrum">Scrum - a little bit more</h3>
                <p>Scrum - work is done in ‘sprints’. Break down big projects into smaller pieces. Project is more manageable, ship high quality work faster and more frequently. More flexibility to adapt and change. Scrums transparency help to overcome problems people come across in the waterfall framework. Short projects help the developers reduce risk and cost, get fast feedback from users , increase speed to market and see the values quicker. As the work is broken down into small sprints, team reaches milestones regularly, gives them sense of regular and tangible progress. Helps them to stay focused and energised, increases satisfaction, motivation.</p>
            
              <h3 id="whatsprint">What are Sprints in scrum?</h3>
                <img src="boltsprint.jpg" alt="not this sprint"/>
              
              <p>A sprint is a short, time-boxed period when a scrum team works to complete a set amount of work. Sprints are at the very heart of scrum and agile methodologies and getting sprints right will help your agile team ship better software with fewer headaches.</p>
        
              <img src="scrumsprint.jpg" alt="scrum sprint diagram"/>
        
              <p>Many associate scrum sprints with agile software development, so much so that scrum and agile are often thought to be the same thing. They’re not. Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting s#it done.</p>
                
              <p>The many similarities between agile values and scrum processes lead to a fair association. Sprints help teams follow the agile principle of "delivering working software frequently," as well as live the agile value of "responding to change over following a plan." The scrum values of transparency, inspection, and adaptation are complementary to agile and central to the concept of sprints.</p>
        
              <h3 id="sprintplan">Sprint planning - The 2 Main Questions</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>What will we get done?</li>
                <li>How will we do it?</li>
              </ol>
        
              <p>Choosing the right work items for a sprint is a collaborative effort between the product owner, scrum master, and development team. The product owner discusses the objective that the sprint should achieve and the product backlog items that, upon completion, would achieve the sprint goal.</p>
              <p>The team then creates a plan for how they will build the backlog items and get them “Done” before the end of the sprint. The work items chosen and the plan for how to get them done is called the sprint backlog. By the end of sprint planning the team is ready to start work on the sprint backlog, taking items from the backlog, to “In-progress,” and “Done."</p>
              <p>During a sprint, the team checks in during the daily scrum, or standup, about how the work is progressing. The goal of this meeting is to surface any blockers and challenges that would impact the teams ability to deliver the sprint goal.
                After a sprint, the team demonstrates what they’ve completed during the sprint review. This is your team’s opportunity to showcase their work to stakeholders and teammates before it hits production
                </p>
                <p>Round out your sprint cycle with my favorite meeting, the sprint retrospective. This is your teams opportunity to identify areas of improvement for the next sprint. With that, you’re ready to start your next sprint cycle. Onward!</p>
        
                <p>KEY POINTS IN THE RETROSPECTIVE</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What should we START doing</li>
                    <li>What should we STOP doing</li>
                    <li>What should we CARRY ON doing</li>
                  </ul>
        
                  <h3 id="dos">Do's & Dont's</h3>
                  <h4>Do's</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Make sure the team sets and understands the sprint goal and how success will be measured. This is the key to keeping everyone aligned and moving forward toward a common destination.</li>
                    <li>Do ensure you have a well-groomed backlog with your priorities and dependencies in order. This can be a big challenge that could derail the process if it’s not properly managed.</li>
                    <li>Ensure you have a good understanding of velocity, and that it reflects things like leave and team meetings.</li>
                    <li>Do use the Sprint Planning meeting to flesh out intimate details of the work that needs to get done. Encourage team members to sketch out tasks for all stories, bugs, and tasks that come into the sprint.</li>
                    <li>Leave out work where you won’t be able to get the dependencies done, like work from another team, designs, and legal sign-off.</li>
                    <li>Finally, once a decision or plan is made, make sure someone captures that information in your project management or collaboration tool, like your Jira tickets. That way, both the decision and the rationale are easy for everyone to see later.</li>
                    </ul>
        
                <h4>Dont's</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don’t pull in too many stories, overestimate velocity, or pull in tasks that can’t be completed in the sprint. You don’t want to set yourself or your team up for failure.</li>
                    <li>Don’t forget about quality or technical debt. Make sure to budget time for QA and non-feature work, like bugs and engineering health.</li>
                    <li>Don’t let the team have a fuzzy view of what's in the sprint. Nail it down, and don’t focus so much on moving fast that you forget to make sure everyone’s moving in the same direction.</li>
                    <li>Also, don’t take on a large amount of unknown or high-risk work. Break down stories that are large or have high uncertainty, and don't be afraid to leave some of that work for the next sprint.</li>
                    <li>If you hear concerns from the team, whether it’s about velocity, low-certainty work, or work they think is bigger than what they estimated, don’t ignore it. Address the issue, and recalibrate when necessary.</li>
                </ul>
